Your contributions become plankton: bigger and brighter the more you commit. Fish paths come from
a deterministic steering-force simulation (momentum, capped turning force, a gentle wander), and
each body is drawn as the fish's own trail: a dense run of translucent circles replaying the head's
path a beat later, with a grow-then-taper size profile and alpha fading toward the tail. In a turn
the body wraps the curve, because the body *is* the curve. Fish graze the year clean; when the pond
empties, night falls and the ecosystem regrows in a seamless loop. Every bite sends a ripple across
the water.

The graph does not just feed the fish, it shapes the ecosystem:

- **Fish count, species and size** respond to active days, contribution energy and consistency.
- **Contribution levels carry energy**: richer plankton changes target choice, swimming pace and satiety.
- **Fish persist between days**: identity, markings and earned growth survive each nightly refresh.
- **Koi and minnows behave differently**: koi favor high-energy food while minnows favor dense grazing areas.
- **The pond has physical relationships**: fish separate from one another, minnows school and all fish avoid lily pads.
- **A 30+ day streak** earns a pond turtle paddling across. 🐢
- **A 21+ day quiet stretch** makes a lotus bloom over its center. 🪷
- **Dark mode is bioluminescent**: an abyssal pond, twinkling plankton, glowing spirit koi.
- **The original light and dark ponds form one 24-hour cycle**: the sun's height and direction move
  the original rays, caustics, surface sheen and shadows through dawn, daylight, dusk and night.
  Each season keeps its own night ecology instead of collapsing into one shared dark palette.
- **Night changes with the moon as well as the season**: a deterministic lunar cycle alters the
  water color and leaves restrained, broken moonlight on the surface only while an illuminated moon
  is above the pond. No weather or astronomy API is required.
- **One current moves the whole surface**: its direction and strength change continuously, then
  propagate through broad water bands, caustics, floor-shadow drift, motes, lily-pad sway and autumn
  leaves instead of giving each layer an unrelated animation.
- **The year moves continuously through four physical ecologies**: spring keeps the original pond,
  summer fills its lily pads with day- and night-blooming flowers while fireflies visit individual
  lotus flowers and leave a synchronized glint,
  and individual maple leaves cross the autumn surface
  with their own drift, rotation and wake. Winter ice and snow become real obstacles that fish route
  around; a streak turtle slows at the edge, climbs onto the ice, leaves tracks step by step and
  splashes back into the water instead of passing beneath it; winter snow settles briefly on those
  same ice shapes but melts into a ripple when it lands on open water.

This `original-plus` branch deliberately keeps the original composition and art direction. Its changes
are behavioral: the same contribution graph now produces a more causal ecosystem instead of adding
new panels, labels or decorative species. Viewers who prefer reduced motion receive a complete still
pond with the fish placed along their real paths.

The published `pond-state.json` is intentionally small and auditable. It contains the public daily
contribution levels, deterministic fish identities and cumulative feeding energy. It never stores
repository names, commit messages, private counts or visitor data. A repeated run over the same
calendar cannot feed the fish twice; only newly visible energy changes the state. Every revision
contains SHA-256 digests of its source calendar, complete state and preceding revision. New revisions
also bind the generator repository and exact 40-character commit SHA into that digest. The same
provenance is embedded in the SVG's `<metadata>` element.

The online explorer reads only GitHub's public contribution calendar through this project's own
Cloudflare Worker, rather than a third-party contribution API. The Worker sets no cookies, emits no
application logs and stores no visitor identifiers; it keeps only a 15-minute edge cache of the public
calendar response. Its source and runtime tests live in [`worker/`](worker/), and the production health
endpoint is [`koipond-contributions.intentflow-inspector.workers.dev/health`](https://koipond-contributions.intentflow-inspector.workers.dev/health).

Everything is baked into a self-contained animated SVG (CSS keyframes, no JavaScript), so it works
anywhere GitHub renders images, including profile READMEs. Because GitHub does not execute JavaScript
inside README images, the Action refreshes the solar-time snapshot every hour; the animation itself
continues locally inside that snapshot.

## Usage (GitHub Action)

Five minutes, four steps, no local setup:

1. Create your profile repository if you do not have one yet: a public repo named exactly after
   your username (for example `octocat/octocat`). Its README is what visitors see on your profile.
2. In that repo, create the file `.github/workflows/koipond.yml` with the workflow below (GitHub
   web UI: Add file, Create new file, paste, commit).
3. Go to the Actions tab, pick `koipond`, press `Run workflow` once. This generates the first SVG
   on an `output` branch. After that it refreshes itself every hour.
4. Paste the `<img>` snippet below into your README, replacing `<user>/<repo>`.

```yaml
name: koipond
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "17 * * * *"
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  generate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: pillowtalk-Qy/koipond@ec02c71e062eb9333951e53191cee777eb51d82e
        with:
          github_user_name: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          outputs: |
            dist/koipond.svg?environment=auto&timezone=480&latitude=22.3193&longitude=114.1694
      - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@84c30a85c19949d7eee79c4ff27748b70285e453 # v4.1.0
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_branch: output
          publish_dir: ./dist
```

Then embed the generated pond in your README:

```html
<a href="https://pillowtalk-qy.github.io/koipond/?user=<user>">
  <img alt="koipond" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<repo>/output/koipond.svg">
</a>
<br>
<sub>This pond follows Hong Kong time and season. Contributions feed it; its fish remember. · <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<repo>/output/pond-state.json">verify state</a></sub>
```

Each `outputs` line accepts options as a query string, and can be a `.svg`, `.gif` or `.mp4`:

```yaml
outputs: |
  dist/koipond.svg?environment=auto&timezone=480&latitude=22.3193&longitude=114.1694
  dist/koipond-light.svg
  dist/koipond-dark.svg?theme=dark
  dist/koipond.gif?theme=dark&fps=10&start=10&dur=8
```

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `theme` | `light` (default) or `dark` |
| `seed` | Any string, changes fish variety and routes (defaults to the username) |
| `environment` | Set to `auto` to derive a continuous solar-time and seasonal pond |
| `timezone` | UTC offset in minutes for the automatic pond (`480` is Hong Kong) |
| `latitude` | Latitude used to calculate daylight (`22.3193` is Hong Kong) |
| `longitude` | Longitude used to calculate true solar time (`114.1694` is Hong Kong) |
| `date` | Optional reproducible date override in `YYYY-MM-DD` form |
| `time` | Optional reproducible local-time override in `HH:MM` form |
| `season` | Optional visual test override: `spring`, `summer`, `autumn` or `winter` |
| `fps` | Video frame rate up to 60 (gif and mp4 only, default 10 for gif, 30 for mp4) |
| `start` | Capture start time in seconds into the loop (default 0) |
| `dur` | Capture length in seconds (default: the full loop) |
| `scale` | Resolution multiplier (default 1 for gif, 2 for mp4) |

The Action also writes `dist/pond-state.json`. Because the workflow publishes the complete `dist`
directory to `output`, the next hourly run restores it automatically. The optional Action inputs
`state_file`, `state_branch` and `state_path` change those locations.

The workflow pins Qy's `original-plus` implementation to a full commit SHA for reproducibility.
To use the original edition instead, follow the setup guide in
[0xydev/koipond](https://github.com/0xydev/koipond#usage-github-action).

GIF and MP4 outputs use a headless Chromium browser and ffmpeg. Both are preinstalled on GitHub
runners, so they just work in the Action. Locally you need Chrome or Edge plus ffmpeg on PATH.

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pillowtalk-Qy/koipond.git
cd koipond
npm install
npm run demo          # generates dist/koipond-{light,dark}.svg + dist/preview.html
```

Open `dist/preview.html` in a browser to watch both themes.

Generate your own pond (no token needed, works with any public profile):

```sh
npx tsx src/cli.ts --user <your-github-login>
```

With a token you get exact contribution counts instead of levels:

```sh
npx tsx src/cli.ts --user <login> --token <token>
```

Preserve fish identity and growth across local runs:

```sh
npx tsx src/cli.ts --user <login> --state dist/pond-state.json
```

Generate the same automatic Hong Kong environment used by the profile workflow:

```sh
npx tsx src/cli.ts --user <login> --environment --timezone-offset 480 --latitude 22.3193 --longitude 114.1694
```

Verify a downloaded state independently:

```sh
npm run verify:state -- dist/pond-state.json
```

Require the state to have been produced by one exact, independently inspectable generator revision:

```sh
npm run verify:state -- dist/pond-state.json --expect-generator=pillowtalk-Qy/koipond@<40-character-sha>
```

To verify one revision links to an earlier state retrieved from Git history:

```sh
npm run verify:state -- pond-state.json previous-pond-state.json
```

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--user` | GitHub login to fetch the contribution calendar for |
| `--token` | GitHub token, falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` env (optional) |
| `--demo` | Use generated demo data instead of the API |
| `--seed` | Override the PRNG seed (defaults to the username) |
| `--theme` | `light`, `dark` or `both` (default `both`) |
| `--environment` | Generate one solar-time and season-aware `koipond-auto.svg` |
| `--date`, `--time` | Optional fixed environment moment for previews or reproducible builds |
| `--timezone-offset` | UTC offset in minutes (default `480`, Hong Kong) |
| `--latitude` | Latitude used for solar altitude (default `22.3193`) |
| `--longitude` | Longitude used for true solar time (default `114.1694`) |
| `--season` | Optional season override for visual testing |
| `--out` | Output directory (default `dist`) |
| `--video` | Also render a `.gif` or `.mp4` of the loop, with the same query options (`pond.mp4?fps=60`) |
| `--state` | Read and update a persistent pond-state JSON file (optional) |
| `--generator-repository` | Generator identity to bind into state, as `owner/repository` (requires `--generator-sha`) |
| `--generator-sha` | Exact 40-character generator commit to bind into state |

## How it works

1. **Data**: GitHub GraphQL `contributionCalendar`, the public contributions page (no token), the
   first-party Worker used by the online explorer, or a deterministic demo generator.
2. **State** (`src/state.ts`): compares the public calendar with the previous published snapshot,
   preserves fish identity and credits only new energy. Canonical JSON and SHA-256 bind the source
   calendar, complete state and previous revision into an independently verifiable chain.
3. **Ecology** (`src/ecology.ts`): contribution levels become conserved energy, activity patterns
   become stable ecosystem traits, and lily-pad and winter-ice geometry are shared by rendering
   and path planning.
4. **Environment** (`src/environment.ts`): calculates solar altitude from date, local time,
   latitude, longitude and the equation of time; approximates lunar illumination and its visible
   passage without an external service; derives one continuous current vector; drives directional
   rays, caustics, shadows and surface activity while blending the original light/dark palettes;
   and derives narrow, overlapping seasonal weights for blooms, maple drift, ice coverage and
   winter stillness.
5. **Planner** (`src/planner.ts`): a seeded steering-physics simulation. Fish accelerate under a
   capped force toward their next plankton, change pace with satiety, separate, school, avoid pond
   obstacles and bounce softly off the walls. Deterministic, so the same grid + seed always bakes
   the same film.
6. **Renderer** (`src/render/svg.ts`): bakes the simulated paths into CSS `@keyframes` (decimated on
   straightaways), draws bodies as delayed trails, and quantizes eat times into 0.5% buckets so
   hundreds of plankton share ~100 keyframe blocks, keeping file size down.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue for bugs and ideas, or send a PR directly.
To get started:

```sh
npm install
npm run demo          # see your changes in dist/preview.html
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run verify:motion # physics, spacing and loop-seam checks
npm run visual:check  # 32 season/phase/profile/viewport baselines
```

After an intentional visual change, inspect the rendered images in `.visual-regression/`, then run
`npm run visual:update` to accept new baselines. Do not update baselines merely to make CI pass.

Pinned Action references have one source of truth: [`release.json`](release.json). After a candidate
commit passes CI, advance every core and Profile reference together with:

```sh
npm run release:sync -- --set=<verified-40-character-sha> --profile=../pillowtalk-Qy-profile
npm run release:check -- --profile=../pillowtalk-Qy-profile
```

Commit the synchronized references as a small follow-up release commit. CI rejects stale core
references automatically.

New species, decor, themes and achievement rules are all good first issues: species live in
`src/render/fish.ts`, decor in `src/render/decor.ts`, colors in `src/render/palette.ts`.
